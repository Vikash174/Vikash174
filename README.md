# Hi there, I'm Vikash Rai! ðŸ‘‹

My professional journey in the world of web development started in 2022. Previously I have worked with [TripStack](https://www.tripstack.com/). here I have worked on C# and Dot Net. 
For new challenges, I started playing with JavaScript and React JS. After spending time with this tech stack I am loving it. Since then I have been learning and building awesome projects.

## ðŸš€ What I do:

- **Front-end Development:** Specializing in React.js, I bring ideas to life by crafting responsive and dynamic user interfaces.

- **State Management:** Proficient in state management libraries like Redux for maintaining a clean and scalable application state.

- **UI/UX Design:** A keen eye for design principles, ensuring that not only does the application work well, but it looks great too.

- **Collaboration:** Experienced in working with cross-functional teams, using version control systems like Git to ensure smooth collaboration.
